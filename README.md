# Notebooks
This is a simple collection of my "scratchwork notebooks" -- a place to store collections of useful information. The subject of these notebooks is far ranging -- some are simply reminders of useful tools while others are more fully fleshed-out research explorations. If you find these useful, great! If you think there is anything useful to add to a notebook, feel free to drop me a line. Notebooks that are prepended with "scratchwork-" are very rough "scratchwork" workspaces for exploring a topic.
